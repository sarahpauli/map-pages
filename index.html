    <h1>A Map of U.S. School Shootings in 2020</h1>

    <div id="map"></div>

    <div>
    <p> In 2020, there were approximately 21 school shootings across the United States, ranging from all areas throughout the country from elementary schools to universities. Despite schools being under lockdown for a majority of the school year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a total of 10 deaths and 13 injuries occurred due to gun violence in educational institutions.</p>

    <p>Who are we to put the safety and wellbeing of innocent children at risk by allowing the masses to own dangerous firearms? Think of your own child or loved one, whose lives could be whisked away by gun violence at any moment. The United States can do better - as a society, we must crack down on improper firearm use to protect our nation's generations to come.</p>
